# Set up @teamsapp

To use GitHub Copilot Chat with `@teamsapp`, you must complete the following steps first. Without these, `@teamsapp` may not function as expected.

## Prerequisites

1. **Get access to GitHub Copilot**  
   GitHub Copilot Free is available to individual GitHub customers by default, with limited access to select features. You could also use Copilot through other organization or enterprise plan. Learn more about [GitHub Copilot plans](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [GitHub Copilot free plan](https://github.com/features/copilot#pricing).
2. **[Install GitHub Copilot Chat for Visual Studio Code](command:fx-extension.installCopilotChat?%5B%22TeamsAgentWalkthrough%22%5D)**
3. **[Install GitHub Copilot extension for Teams Toolkit](command:fx-extension.openInstallTeamsAgent?%5B%22TeamsAgentWalkthrough%22%5D)**

After completing these steps, you can use `@teamsapp` to chat with GitHub Copilot and explore Teams app or Microsoft 365 Copilot agent development.
